# Event Scheduler

## Description
This is a .NET Core console application that schedules events for maximum time efficiency and quality of life. The application takes into account the user's spatial constraints and the priority of events to maximize the total value of attended events throughout the day. The goal is to spend as much time as possible attending events, starting from the earliest event and considering the proximity and priority of subsequent events.

## Features
- Schedule events based on start and end times, locations, and priority.
- Consider travel times between locations.
- Maximize total value by attending events with the highest priority.
- Ensure no overlapping events are attended.

## Requirements
- **.NET Core 8**
- **C#**
